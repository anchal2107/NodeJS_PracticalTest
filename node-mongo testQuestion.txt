Hello Anchal,
Responding to your queries below.

Need to use MongoDb as database or postgresSQL
- If you are comfortable with PostgresSQL is fine else mongodb.

What about front end, "Api are okay.", But do i need to create front-end in form of HTML page in nodeJs it-self right?
- No need for frontend, just create rest apis and please create postman for them and share it along with the code.

Regards
